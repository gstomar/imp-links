Indahash will hit the market crazy 
spectre, ubiq, funfair, 0x, waves, opus and blue.
 IOTA, Universa, Bitcoinwhite, DeepOnion
Fair judgement and reasoning. KCS, a Kucoin token may also be a good investment.
Coins Like NEO, Vechain, Cardano, NEM, Celsius, SALT may too get a lift up.
 Universa could become top10 coin in a few months/years.

but at least for the first half my bigger holds are:
1. DeepOnion
2. Neo
3. Ethos
4. ARK
XVG
Electroneum
NXT and IOTA in 2018 will grow up too

1- Ripple
2- Verge
3- Ada

EOS - mainnet release in 2018, it can become an Ethereum competitor
XMR -  best privacy coin, lot of use cases available
MOD - undervalued coin backed by a solid team with working product in the pharma industry

 2018 are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Deeponion, Dash and Pura
HODLLLLL! long term=UNIFY,RUPX

you cited " waves " , it's a very cool currency that has something to add to crypto world, it's even called Russia Eth ; and these are some predictions about its future : 
Current price : 12.91$
Within 1 year : 18.77 $
Within 5 years : 82.00 $
PS: waves is more suitable for long term investment
