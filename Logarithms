The logarithm to base 10 (that is b = 10) is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering. 

The natural logarithm has the number e (â‰ˆ 2.718) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and physics, because of its simpler derivative. 

The binary logarithm uses base 2 (that is b = 2) and is commonly used in computer science.
