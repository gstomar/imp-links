String switch in Java 7 is implemented using a fixed size map with a number of slots close to 20. This means that you can freely use it in most of cases not worrying about its performance at all. As you have seen, string switch has identical performance compared to manually implemented maps when you have under 100 cases in the switch.

String.equals/equalsIgnoreCase perform great as a replacement for string switch while all your cases have different length (or at least the number of cases with the same string length is too low compared to the total number of cases) and the number of string cases is not too big. This property is achieved by comparing string length prior to comparing the actual contents in String.equals/equalsIgnoreCase.
