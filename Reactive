we want systems that are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven. We call these Reactive Systems.

Responsive: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible. Responsiveness is the cornerstone of usability and utility, but more than that, responsiveness means that problems may be detected quickly and dealt with effectively. 

Resilient: The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies not only to highly-available, mission critical systems â€” any system that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a failure. Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation. 

Elastic: The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs. 

Message Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency. This boundary also provides the means to delegate failures as messages.
